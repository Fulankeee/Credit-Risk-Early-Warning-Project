Business Problem:
A financial institution wants to proactively identify borrowers who are at high risk of default, so that early interventions (credit limit reduction, outreach, or monitoring) can be applied.

Objective:
Build an early-warning credit risk model that predicts whether a loan will become delinquent or charged off.

Target Variable:
Loan default indicator derived from loan_status.

Stakeholders:
Credit risk analysts, portfolio managers, and risk governance teams.

Success Metric:
ROC-AUC and KS statistic to balance ranking power and risk separation.
