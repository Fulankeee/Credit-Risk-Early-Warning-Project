# Credit Risk Early Warning System

## Business Problem
Banks need to identify customers who are likely to become delinquent early, in order to manage risk and take proactive actions.

This project builds an end-to-end credit risk early warning pipeline using SQL, Python, and machine learning, with a focus on explainability and monitoring.

## Data
Public credit risk data is used to simulate a real-world retail banking environment.

## Methodology
1. SQL-based data modeling and feature snapshots
2. Feature engineering using historical behavior
3. Statistical baseline model (logistic regression)
4. Machine learning model (tree-based)
5. Model explainability and monitoring
6. Dashboard for risk analysts

## Tools
- Python (pandas, scikit-learn)
- SQL
- Power BI / Tableau
- Statistics
